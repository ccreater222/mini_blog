<h1>Styles</h1>

<p>This section covers basic HTML tags, such as headings, buttons, form controls or lists.  Think of these as the building blocks that can either be used on their own or to create components or layouts.</p>

<p>Groups of tags are included in cases where a single element should not exist on its own.  For example, an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag should usually be accompanied by a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>, so those two are demonstrated as a single pattern.</p>
