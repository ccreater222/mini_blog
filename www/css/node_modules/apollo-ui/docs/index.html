      <p>This site contains developer documentation for the following resources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Styles</b>: This page includes most basic styles, like grid, typography, buttons, forms, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Icons</b>: Shows how you can implement and style our icons in various ways, including a complete list of all {{ site.data._icons | size }} icons in our custom set!</li>
        <li><b>Components</b>: These are made up mostly using multiple items from the styles section, plus some component-specific treatment.  Examples include login form, navbar, dropdowns and more.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="pad-top font-italic">NOTE: This project is in development, so stay tuned for more additions and improvements in the coming months.  The design for this site is a basic placeholder using core styles from Apollo.  A new design will be implemented when these docs are incorporated into the Design Resource Base later this year.</p>
